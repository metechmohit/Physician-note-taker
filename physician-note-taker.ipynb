        "    Physician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?\n",
        "    Patient: It's not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It's nothing like before, though.\n",

        "    Patient: It's not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It's nothing like before, though.\n",
        "    Physician: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?\n",
        "    Patient: No, nothing like that. I don't feel nervous driving, and I haven't had any emotional issues from the accident.\n",
        "    Physician: And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?\n",
        "    Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn't really stopped me from doing anything.\n",

        "    Physician: Yes, your recovery so far has been quite positive. Given your progress, I'd expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration.\n",
        "    Patient: That's great to hear. So, I don't need to worry about this affecting me in the future?\n",
        "    Physician: That's right. I don't foresee any long-term impact on your work or daily life. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up. But at this point, you're on track for a full recovery.\n",
